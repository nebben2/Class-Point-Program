Class Point System Version 0.3a

* To set the returns use the files marked [Number of points]Output.properties
e.g. Reaching -5 points would display what is written in NegativeFiveOutput.properties

* To activate the program run 'Classofclasspointsystem.class' and input the amount you want to change the current value by, use negative values to decrease the current number of points

* Don't touch any other files as they allow the program to work

* If it doesn't work download the latest version of java at: https://java.com/en/download/

* And if that doesn't work tell me and I'll try to fix the issue just please be aware that the project is in alpha and so bugs are inevitable
